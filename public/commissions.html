                <h3><a href="https://ko-fi.com/geno7_">ko-fi.com/geno7_</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Tip me <strong>$10 minimum</strong> on ko-fi with a few descriptive words! A genre, a vibe, a theme for a character, what have you! I'll use that description to make you a little
                    song!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Songs will be "Musical Sketches" - lofi, less than 30 seconds, and with simple instrumentation. As opposed to regular music commissions, the process is quicker and simpler, but
                    does <strong>NOT</strong> involve revisions/corrections. Songs will be posted as videos on <a href="https://twitter.com/geno7_">Twitter</a> and with accompanying
                    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tPgUio2-vord6PtYh4KlITIrotEJLpdw?usp=sharing">Google Drive</a> links, I'll reply to your ko-fi message with a link to the song once
                    it's done.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You're free to use a music sketch how you want (barring stuff that promotes hate speech) but they're not really something intended for use in serious for-profit stuff, they're just kinda fun doodles. If you really like the music sketch I made you and are interested in having me flesh it out into a full song, we can talk.

                    This is the option to go with if you're wanting a more involved commission. I'll send WIP demos of the songs I work on for you! Feel free to ask me for revisions.
                    <strong>$10 for every revision after the first two.</strong>
                </p>

                <h3>On Revisions</h3>
                <p>
                    What exactly constitutes a "Revision" is sort of nebulous but at the beginning of a song's life, it's something we're both kinda figuring out as I'm roughing it out. However, if a
                    song reaches a later stage when a lot of work has been done on it and it's requested of me to redo a significant enough portion of it or change direction to a drastic enough
                    degree, the amount of work I'm doing starts to add up and I want to make sure I'm compensated for it, which is why I charge $10 per revision after the first two revisions. But I
                    definitely err on the side of the client with this and I always make sure to let you know if something is gonna count as a revision because I never want to charge you without your
                    knowledge.
                </p>
                <h3>Ownership</h3>
                <p>
                    Generally speaking, any song I make you you're free to use however you want, barring stuff that promotes hate speech and all that. If a song is for a project that you intend to profit from, we may need to discuss further details, but it varies on a case-by-case basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any compositions I make for you I reserve the rights to use or sell (as physical or digital album(s), as streaming, as monetized YouTube uploads, etc) and keep any profits, however, if a song is being made for a project and you'd prefer I wait for the project to be released before I make the song public, I'm totally fine with that.
                </p>

                <P>
                    If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me!
